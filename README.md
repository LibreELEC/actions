# LibreELEC Actions - <https://libreelec.tv>

The **LibreELEC _actions_** provide the CI/CD for the **LibreELEC** project. The **actions** execute the nightly build jobs (both for *images* and *addons*) for both the stable (*libreelec-12.0*), and master branches. There are also other workflows that are used to maintain the infrastructure that supports the CI/CD.

Forks of this **_actions_ repository** can be used to run your own CI/CD for **LibreELEC**, or for your own development / contributions to https://github.com/LibreELEC/actions.
